stress-ng options

--class name
              specify  the  class of stressors to run. Stressors are classified into one or more of the fol‚Äê
              lowing classes: cpu, cpu-cache, device, gpu, io, interrupt, filesystem, memory,  network,  os,
              pipe,  scheduler,  signal  and  vm.   Some stressors fall into just one class. For example the
              'get' stressor is just in the 'os' class. Other stressors fall into more than one  class,  for
              example,  the  'lsearch' stressor falls into the 'cpu', 'cpu-cache' and 'memory' classes as it
              exercises all these three.  Selecting a specific class will run all the  stressors  that  fall
              into that class only when run with the --sequential option.

              Specifying a name followed by a question mark (for example --class vm?) will print out all the
              stressors in that specific class.


--log-file filename
              write messages to the specified log file.


--timestamp
              add a timestamp in hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of a second to the log output.


-r N, --random N
              start N random stress workers. If N is 0, then the number of configured processors is used for
              N.

--progress
              display the run progress when running stressors with the --sequential option.

       -q, --quiet
              do not show any output.

--skip-silent
              silence messages that report that a stressor has been skipped because it requires features not
              supported by the system, such as unimplemented system calls, missing  resources  or  processor
              specific features.
